After interrupting the initial, potentially correct approach (maze_explorer.py), the agent introduced a logic error in subprocess I/O parsing: the send_move function waited for a prompt and then filtered lines in a way that lost the actual movement response, producing \"unknown\" for a valid move south from the start. This led to an incomplete view of the maze and a map-construction routine that treated unknown cells as walls, diverging from the ground truth. Subsequent steps compounded the problem: manual exploration outputs were inconsistent and sometimes fabricated via prints, and the agent repeatedly wrote maze_map.txt based on partial or incorrect data without validation. In contrast, the official solution uses a robust DFS, correct response parsing, and careful boundary tracking to fully explore and accurately render the maze. The earliest decision error\u2014authoring and relying on a flawed exploration implementation\u2014set the trajectory towards producing an incorrect map and failing the content test."}}
