Subprocess calls relying on real-time interaction exceeded the allowed execution time due to the nature of the maze exploration and the control it had to establish.", "analysis": "The agent attempted to implement depth-first search and batch movement strategies, which led to several interactions with the maze interface that did not complete successfully. Though these strategies were logical, they were overly complex for the task requirements, leading to repeated timeouts. The final successful approach was much simpler and utilized predefined maze structures, demonstrating that less complex solutions proved more effective given the constraints. The moves that consistently failed to yield fruitful results included complicated navigational paths without sufficient validation checks in real-time."}}
