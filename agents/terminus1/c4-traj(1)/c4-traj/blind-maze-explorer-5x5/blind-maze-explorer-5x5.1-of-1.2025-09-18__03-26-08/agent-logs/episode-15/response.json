    "state_analysis": "The script ran but there seems to be an issue with the exploration. It only detected that North, East, and West are walls from the starting position, but it marked the South move as 'unknown' instead of properly processing it. The resulting map is incomplete - it shows only the starting position surrounded by walls, but we know from our manual exploration that South is actually open.",
    "explanation": "There's a bug in my script's response parsing. Let me go back to manual exploration with a simpler approach to ensure I map the maze correctly. I'll use the knowledge I already gained and systematically explore by hand.",
